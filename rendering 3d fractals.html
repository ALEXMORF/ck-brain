<h2>rendering 3d fractals</h2>

<h3>What are Fractals?</h3>

<p>Say you start with some kind of space, be it 2D or 3D. For every single point p in that space, you apply some test f(). As a result, all points that pass the test f() will form some
kind of geometry. And if your test f() is just right, these points will form what is called, a fractal.</p>

<p>Of course, that's just one interpretation of fractal. I don't know enough math to give you an actual mathematical view on what fractals are. But the above expalanation should suffice for 
what we are about to do. Let's first solidify this concept by introducing the most famous fractal of all: the Mandelbrot set.</p>

<h3>The Mandelbrot Set</h3>

<p>The Mandelbrot Set is a fractal that exists in the complex plane. It is formed by complex numbers that obey the following rule:</p>

<center>
<p><b>A complex number c is a part of the Mandelbrot Set if its length does not diverge under an infinite amount of iterations of this reccurance function:</b></p>
<p><b>z<sub>n</sub> = z<sub>n-1</sub>*z<sub>n-1</sub> + c</b></p>
<p><b>where the base case is:</b></p>
<p><b>z<sub>0</sub> = 0 + 0i</b></p>
<p><b>where both z and c are complex numbers</b></p>
</center>

<p>If the magnitude of <b>z<sub>infinity</sub></b> does not diverge towards infinity, that that point is a part of the Mandelbrot set. An intuitive way to interpret this test is to  imagine 
the complex number to be orbiting on the complex plane. And with each iteration, more complex numbers orbits too far and eventually diverges out to infinity.<p>

<p>Of course, it's non-practical to test against infinity amount of iterations or a distance of infinity. There are some shortcuts we can take. For example, it is known that if the magnitude
 of a complex number is above 2, then it is at the point of no return. As for iterations, for a finite resolution, if the iteration is sufficiently high then it will produce an image that 
is practically the same one produced by an infinite amount of iterations.</p>

<p>Here are a series of screenshots with different amount of iterations. You can clearly see that with each iteration, more points on the complex plane gets "carved" out, and 
converges into an interesting shape.</p>

<center>
<p>5 iterations:</p>
<img src="./data/mandelbrot_5.JPG">
<p>10 iterations:</p>
<img src="./data/mandelbrot_10.JPG">
<p>15 iterations:</p>
<img src="./data/mandelbrot_15.JPG">
</center>

<p>The above Mandelbrot Set shapes are colored using what's formally called "Escape Time", it just 
means how many iterations it took for the point to diverge. The entire source code for the above 
images is below (runs on shadertoy):</p>

<h3>Defining the 3D Julia Set</h3>

<p>So that was how most 2D fractals are made. Recall that whether or not a point is accepted 
into the fractal set depends on its behavior when <b>orbitting</b>. In order to create interesting
3D fractals, we must find some way to make 3D points <b>orbit</b> in some interesting ways.</p>

<p>The first thought is finding the equivalent of complex numbers in 3D space. Well, there aren't 
really any. But there are quaternions, which are the equivalent of complex numbers in 4D space.</p>

<p>We can try convert 3D points into quaternions by stubbing zero into one 
of the dimensions, then borrow the same orbit equations from the Mandelbrot Set. However,
I will make a small tweak to the rules. Why? well, spoiler alert, the 3D Mandelbrot Set isn't 
that interesting without some extra rotations. And this new variant, called Julia Set, is much
more interesting when done in 3D.</p>

<center>
<p><b>A quaternion z is a part of the Julia Set if its length does not diverge under an infinite amount of iterations of this reccurance function:</b></p>
<p><b>z<sub>n</sub> = z<sub>n-1</sub>*z<sub>n-1</sub> + c</b></p>
<p><b>where the base case is:</b></p>
<p><b>z<sub>0</sub> = z</b></p>
<p><b>where z is a quaternion converted from the 3d point being tested, and c is some constant quaternion.</b></p>
</center>

<p>If a point p, when converted into its equivalent quaternion z, does not diverge under this test,
then we can say it is a part of the 3D Julia Set.</p>

<p>So we have defined some rules for our new 3D fractal, but how do we actually render them? The 
screen is 2D, so there is no convenient ways to slap the fractal onto the screen like we did with
the Mandelbrot Set.</p>

<h3>Constant Stepped Raytracing</h3>

<p>An ostensible approach is to do raytracing on these 3D fractals. But in order to carry this out,
we need some way to do intersection test between rays and the 3D fractals's surface. But we only 
have point test available to us. What we can do, is to step along the ray cautiously and test if 
the current point is within the fractal at each step. </p>

<p>Since we are stepping at a constant rate. We also can't make the step size too big, as the ray 
will overshoot and cause artifacts in our final image. We also can't let the step size be too small, 
otherwise the rendering process will take up too much time.</p>

<p>Here's one out of millions of rays stepping along to test against the 3D fractal geometry</p>
<center><img src="./data/raymarch_constant.JPG"></center>

<p>This solution is probably the simplest solution. It is guaranteed to work, but it's too slow
to be desirable.</p>

<h3>Raytracing with Distance Estimators</h3>

<p>In Hart's paper, <a href="http://delivery.acm.org/10.1145/80000/74363/p289-hart.pdf?ip=128.54.102.127&id=74363&acc=ACTIVE%20SERVICE&key=CA367851C7E3CE77%2E30F2CC1B2E6C2B37%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35&__acm__=1527206615_c23636e643331954bf952547f27a7a03">
Ray Tracing Deterministic 3-D Fractals</a>, he shows the following equation:</p>

<center><img src="./data/fractal_estimator.JPG"></center>

<p><b>f<sup>n</sup>(z)</b> carries the same meaning as our <b>z<sub>n</sub></b>. And 
<b>f'<sup>n</sup>(z)</b>, as you might have guessed, is the derivative of <b>f<sup>n</sup>(z)</b>.
</p>

<p>The value of this expression, <b>d(z)</b>, gives the <b>distance estimator</b> to our 3D fractal. 
Distance estimator allows us to create an unbounding sphere around z, the point being tested. It tells
us that the 3D fractal must be at least <b>d(z)</b> amount of distance away from our current point.
Therefore, instead of stepping a constant length, we can advance the ray by the estimated distance
returned by the distance estimator.</p>

<p>A ray stepping using the distance estimator. The circles in the images are unbounding volumes that 
allows the ray to advance in big steps without overshooting</p>

<center><img src="./data/raymarch_de.JPG"></center>

<p>Note that the distance estimator only ensures to be the lower bound of the closest distance between current
point and the 3D fractal. It might not be anywhere near the actual distance value, hence the word "estimator".</p>

<p>Still, two questions linger: how did we arrive at this distance estimator equation, and 
how do we compute the derivative of the orbit of z? Well, let's hold on to the first question 
for a big longer, and see how to compute the derivative first.</p> 

<h3>Calculating the Derivative of an Orbit</h3>

<p>We can obtain the derivative of a running orbit by first differentiating our recurrance 
functions:</p>

<center>
<p><b>z<sub>0</sub>' = 1</b></p>
<p><b>z<sub>n</sub>' = 2*z<sub>n-1</sub>*z<sub>n-1</sub>' (chain rule)</b></p>
</center>

<p>Using these two equations, we can keep track of the orbit derivative as we run the iterative orbit
on the quaternion being tested. Now we hold all the elements we need to compute an estimated distance to
a 3D Julia Set. So why don't we write out the code to compute the estimated distance, given an arbitrary point?</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/ALEXMORF/0eb6ab1d7c727ffd2c9007c4018504e2.js"></script>

<h3>Raymarching Using the Distance Estimator</h3>

<p>As I have alluded to, we can incorporate the new distance estimator to speed up our raytracing
process dramatically. Instead of stepping constant distances, we can update the stepping distance 
to be the estimated distance. Just for completion's sake, here's the code:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/ALEXMORF/66ae101fd2c33e1e21402cafa6cee697.js"></script>

<p>Using the above equations, and a little bit of lighting tricks, we can already get nice 
fractal renders:</p>

<center>
<p><b>Julia set, with c = 0.1i + 0.3j + 0.9k + 0.1</b></p>
<img src="./data/julia_set.bmp">
</center>

<p>For this render, a secondary ray is traced towards the light source to compute shadow.
The fake ambient occlusion is just an inverse of the iteration fog.</p>

<center>
<p><b>Here's the source code that rendered the above image.</b></p>
<a href="./data/fractal.cpp">fractal.cpp</a>
</center>

<p>It doesn't require any dependency to
run and it doesn't rely on external platform API. Due to the same reasons, I don't have multithreading
or SIMD to speed it up. If you have a decent computer, expect around 40~50 seconds to spit out
the rendered picture. But hey, you can run it on all platforms without any convoluted build tools.</p>

<p><b>EDIT: for some reason at the time of this writing, I seemed to forget that the new C++ standard 
includes mulithreading libraries. So I went ahead and added a simple multithreaded job system with 
std::thread and std::atomic. This multithreaded version finishes rendering in around 7~8 seconds, 
which is a huge speed up. Since I only used the standard library, you can still run it on all platforms
with a single build command.</b></p>

<h3>More Variations, Only Limited by Your Imagination</h3>

<p>There are so many more variations of 3D fractals. Recall the process that we used to come up
with a the Julia Set. There are countless other things you can try for the orbitting process
and you might get some really interesting results. Here is a <a href="http://www.bugman123.com/Hypercomplex/index.html">
a whole gallery of them discovered by others</a>.</p>

<p>What's more, you can tweak the existing orbit equations by applying transformations to them 
in each iteration. For example, I changed the Julia Set by applying some extra translation to the 
quaternion in each iteration. I think of it as "pulling" the quaternion towards a certain direction
during their orbit: </p>

<center><img src="./data/julia_set_pulled.bmp"></center>

<h3>"Infinite" Details</h3>

<p>What's truly fascinating about fractals are their infinite details. If what you're rendering is a true fractal, 
no matter how much you zoom in into the fractal, there will always be more variations to find. Due to this property,
The derivative of any point on the surface of a 3d fractal is undefined (which is not always true in the fractals that
we created ourselves, which makes them fake fractals). An easy way to zoom into a 3d fractal is to scale the space in which
the fractal resides. By doing so, you are scaling down the camera space and seeing more details out of the fractal.</p>

<p>With the tools that we explored in this article, you should be able to easily write a pathtrace that produces 
image that is infinitely more physically accurate, like the one below (source code included).</p>
