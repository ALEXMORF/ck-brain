<h2>practical guide to quaternion</h2>
<hr>
<p><b>This article serves as the practical guide only. It's probably useful if you are a graphics 
or game programmer, but not so useful if you are a math person. Enough preamble, let's get started.</b></p>

<p><b>NOTATION: In this article, when you see a multiplication between a vector value and a scalar value, it always means component-wise multiplication.</b></p>

<h3>What is a quaternion?</h3>

<p>A quaternion is just one of the many representations of rotation in 3d space. It is praised 
for being easily-interpolatable and space-efficient. It's a lot more light-weight than the heavy
3x3 rotation matrix (4 floats vs 9 floats), and it's a lot easier to use than Euler angle. (axis/angle representation vs rotation angle around all 3 axis)
You probably have seen it in its complex form, which is encoded by four coefficients.</p>

<center><b>xi + yj + zk + w</b></center>

<p>Where the imaginary components i, j, and k obeys the following properties</p>

<center><b>i<sup>2</sup> = i<sup>2</sup> = i<sup>2</sup> = ijk = -1</b></center>

<h3>Unit Quaternion's pragmatic usage in 3D</h3>

<p>Since we are using quaternions to encode rotation, we can restrict ourselves to only use unit quaternions,
meaning the magnitude of the quaternion (as a 4d vector) is equal to 1. In order to use quaternion for 3d rotation, you need to know these two equation:</p>

<center><p><b>rotation around v (axis) by w (angle in radians): q = (v * sin(w/2), cos(w/2)) </b></p></center>

<p>This is how you typically construct a quaternion out of a given rotation in 3d, using the axis-angle representation.</p>

<center><p><b>rotating p with q: p' = q * f(p) * q<sup>-1</sup></b></p></center>

<p>This is how you rotate point p with rotation encoded in q, where f(p) is the quaternion equivalent of p, 
and q<sup>-1</sup> being the inverse of q. I don't really have anything to say about these two equations, as I myself don't 
know how and why they work. I just know that they work and memorizing these two equations is enough for most stuff I do.</p>

<p>But in order to evaluate this equation, we must first solve the following equations</p>

<center>
<p><b>Conjegate (inverse): q<sup>-1</sup> = ?</b></p>
<p><b>Multiplication: q<sub>1</sub>*q<sub>2</sub> = ?</b></p>
<p><b>p -> q: f(p) = ?</b></p>
</center>

<h3>Conjegate (Inverse)</h3>

<p>The conjegate of quaternion q is quite intuitive. Recall that a unit quaternion is encoded as
(v * sin(w/2), cos(w/2)), where w is the rotation angle. The inverse of this rotation operation 
is simply rotation in the other direction. Therefore:

<center><b>q<sup>-1</sup> = (v * sin(-w/2), cos(-w/2))</b></center>

<p>And since cos(-w) = cos(w) and sin(-w) = -sin(w), we can factor out the inner negative sign out of cos() and sin():</p>

<center><b>q<sup>-1</sup> = (v * -sin(w/2), cos(w/2))</b></center>

<p>We can easily apply this to the complex form as well:</p>

<center><b>q<sup>-1</sup> = (-q.x, -q.y, -q.z, q.w)</b></center>

<p>Another important property of the inverse of quaternion is the following:</p>

<center><b>(q1 * q2)<sup>-1</sup> = q2<sup>-1</sup> * q1<sup>-1</sup></b></center>

<p>It's quite analogous to matrices in this respect.

<h3>Our magical f(p)</h3>

<p>f(p) is just a convinence notation that I used to denote "treating p as a quaternion" to meet the type-checking.
It is very simple, just use all the components from p as q's imaginary component, and add a 0 as q's real component:</p>

<center><b>q = f(p) = (p.x, p.y, p.z, 0)</b></center>

<h3>Multiplication</h3>

<p>I find this very poorly covered by most tutorials, and therefore I will spend the majority of this article
talking about the derivation of quaternion multiplication and some useful intuition. I believe you have come across
complex numbers in your middle school algebra class:</p>

<center><b>x + yi</b></center>

<p>In order to do operations on complex numbers such as the one above, you just have to treat i
as an unknown variable first, do the maths as if these complex numbers are polynomials,  
apply the <b>i<sup>2</sup> = -1 </b> rule to the expression, then regroup the numbers as coefficient (real part and imgainary part). Here's an example:</p>

<center><b>(a + bi)(c + di) = ac + adi + bci + bdi<sup>2</sup></b></center>
<center><b>= ac + adi + bci - bd</b></center>
<center><b>= (ac - bd) + (ad + bc)i</b></center>

<p>Simple, right? Well, multiplying quaternions is very much the same. It just has 3 imaginary numbers rather than 1, which means we will have to
regroup the numbers as 4 different coefficients. However, do note that the multiplication of two different imaginary numbers, such as ij, is non-commutative. 
That means ij is not the same as ji. More on that later, for now, let q1 = (x1, y1, z1, w1) and q2 = (x2, y2, z2, w2). Let's try solving q1 * q2:</p>

<center><b>(x1i + y1j + z1k + w1)(x2i + y2j + z2k + w2)</b></center>
<center><b>= (x1i * x2i + x1i * y2j + x1i * z2k + x1i * w2) +  <br>
(y1j * x2i + y1j * y2j + y1j * z2k + y1j * w2) + <br>
(z1k * x2i + z1k * y2j + z1k * z2k + z1k * w2) + <br>
(w1 * x2i + w1 * y2j + w1 * z2k + w1 * w2)</b></center>

<br>
<center><b>(Now watch out, the order of multiplication between i,j, and k matters! e.g. ij != ji)</b></center>
<br>

<center><b>= (x1x2i<sup>2</sup> + x1y2ij + x1z2ik + x1w2i) + <br>
(y1x2ji + y1y2j<sup>2</sup> + y1z2jk + y1w2j) + <br>
(z1x2ki + z1y2kj + z1z2k<sup>2</sup> + z1w2k) + <br>
(w1x2i + w1y2j + w1z2k + w1w2)</b></center>

<p>Recall that <b>i<sup>2</sup> = j<sup>2</sup> = k<sup>2</sup> = -1</b>, we can simplify some of the terms:</p>

<center><b>q1q2 = (-x1x2 + x1y2ij + x1z2ik + x1w2i) + <br>
(y1x2ji - y1y2 + y1z2jk + y1w2j) + <br>
(z1x2ki + z1y2kj - z1z2 + z1w2k) + <br>
(w1x2i + w1y2j + w1z2k + w1w2)</b></center>

<p>Umm, looks like we are stuck. Remember we need the result of this multiplication to become its original complex form, which should only have
4 terms: <b>xi + yj + zk + w</b>. But now we've got terms such as <b>ik</b>, how do we simplify that? Well, let's go back to i, j, k's properties:</p>

<center><b>i<sup>2</sup> = j<sup>2</sup> = k<sup>2</sup> = ijk = -1</b></center>

<p>This is very handy for solving the problem I just described. Let's say we are solving for <b>ij</b>. We know the following is true:</p>

<center><b>ijk = -1</b></center>

<p>We then right-multiply k on both sides:</p>

<center><b>ijk<sup>2</sup> = -k</b></center>
<center><b>ij(-1) = -k</b></center>

<p>Then we factor out the -1</p>

<center><b>ij = k</b></center>

<p>Done! We can solve for the rest of these with similar procedures. We get:</p>

<p><b>NOTE: Need to explain this part better</b></p>

<center><b>ij = k</b></center>
<center><b>ik = -j</b></center>
<center><b>jk = i</b></center>

<center><b>ji = -k</b></center>
<center><b>ki = j</b></center>
<center><b>kj = -i</b></center>

<p>With these two equations, we can finally go back and solve for q1 * q2:</p>

<center><b>q1q2 = (-x1x2 + x1y2ij + x1z2ik + x1w2i) + <br>
(y1x2ji - y1y2 + y1z2jk + y1w2j) + <br>
(z1x2ki + z1y2kj - z1z2 + z1w2k) + <br>
(w1x2i + w1y2j + w1z2k + w1w2)</b></center>

<center><b>q1q2 = (-x1x2 + x1y2k - x1z2j + x1w2i) + <br>
(-y1x2k - y1y2 + y1z2i + y1w2j) + <br>
(z1x2j - z1y2i - z1z2 + z1w2k) + <br>
(w1x2i + w1y2j + w1z2k + w1w2)</b></center>

<p>Now refactor all the terms, and we get our answer:</p>

<center><b>q1q2 = (x1w2 + y1z2 - z1y2 + w1x2)i + <br>
(-x1z2 + y1w2 + z1x2 + w1y2)j + <br>
(x1y2 - y1x2 + z1w2 + w1z2)k + <br>
(w1w2 - x1x2 - y1y2 - z1z2)</b></center>

<h3>A little bonus</h3>

<p>So if you are a programmer and you are trying to implement quaternion multiplication, then
this is a small treat for you. You probably already found out this pattern anyways, but this is the 
fast version of quaternion multiply (in psuedo GLSL): 

<center><b>q1q2 = (q1.xyz*q2.w + q2.xyz*q1.w + cross(q1.xyz, q2.xyz), q1.w*q2.w - dot(q1.xyz,q2.xyz))</b></center>

<p>Where the multiplications between vector and scalar are per-component. You might wonder what the weird .xyz or .w are. They
are the <a href="https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Data_Type_(GLSL)#Swizzling">swizzle operations</a> that I am borrowing from GLSL for convenience's sake.</p>

<h3>Concatenation between Quaternions as Rotations</h3>
<p>Rotation concatenation is another common operation that you want to do all the time. You can achieve this easily by multiplying quaternions, but you must do so in reverse order (remember, 
rotations in 3d space is non-commutative and therefore the order actually matters). Why is that? Let's expand this equation:</p>

<center><b>p' = q * f(p) * q<sup>-1</sup></b></center>
<center><b>p' = (q1 * q2) * f(p) * (q1 * q2)<sup>-1</sup></b></center>

<p>Recall from the "Conjegate" section, when you inverse a multiplication of two quaternions, the order must be inversed as well. Therefore, when we distribute the -1 power, this is what we get:</p>

<center><b>p' = (q1 * q2) * f(p) * (q2<sup>-1</sup> * q1<sup>-1</sup>)</b></center>
<center><b>p' = q1 * (q2 * f(p) * q2<sup>-1</sup>) * q1<sup>-1</sup></b></center>

<p>Because q2<sup>-1</sup> is applied before q1<sup>-1</sup>, q2's encoded rotation will be applied to p before q1's does.</p>

<p>So if you want R1 to occur before R2, the right way of concatenating the two quaternions is this:</p>

<center><b>q = q2 * q1</b></center>

<h3>Lerp</h3>

<p>Quaternions are known for being easily lerp'able. In my opinion, this is the single feature that makes quaternion the best representation of rotations in 3d space. It makes coding a 3d 
animation system so goddamn easy. You can lerp between two quaternions exactly like how you lerp two 3d points, except you must re-normalize the lerp result between quaternions, since we want
to preserve the unit-ness in them to represent rotations in 3d space.</p>

<center><b>lerp(q1, q2, t) = normalize((1-t)*q1 + t*q2)</b></center>

<h3>Quaternion Double Cover and "Shortest Path" Lerp</h3>

<p>Lerp between quaternions always land on the shortest path in 4D, period. So what is this section for? Well, If you were to do a 3D animation system with quaternions, you'd notice that, even
when you lerp two rotations that are quite close, the lerp() might decide to take route that is perceptually the longest path. That is due to anoter of quaternion's properties: double cover, meaning
that due to the factor of 2 inside quaternions (recall from the very first section, a axis-angle representation of quaternion is (v * sin(w/2), cos(w/2))), a quaternion covers a 720 degrees of 
rotation space instead of a meager 360 degrees.</p>

<p>In order to have a lerp that is perceptually the shortest path in 3d, you must place the 
two quaternions in the same neighborhood. Long story short, if dot product between two quaternions (just a dot product treating the two as 4d vectors) is less than 0, then they are in two
different neighborhoods. Therefore, you need to reflect one of the quaternions into the other's neighborhood.</p>

<p>Now, becaues quaternions are double cover due to the factor of 2 within its axis-angle equation, it means that
q and itself own negation, -q, hold the "same" rotation in 3d (not actually the same, it's proven that in the physical world that a 360 degree rotation and 720 degree rotation are actually 
different ... I know, mind blown). We can simply negate one of them so that both are in the same neighborhood. To achieve that, we multiply 
the sign of dot product between the two quaternions to one of the quaternions in the lerp() equation.</p>

<center><b>shortest_lerp(q1, q2, t) = normalize(sign(dot(q1, q2))*(1-t)*q1 + t*q2)</b></center>
